    "\n",
    "In this section of the code, we focus on converting the unit of area in the real estate transaction dataset from square meters to the commonly used unit in Taiwan, \"ping.\" This conversion is crucial for in-depth analysis of the Taiwanese real estate market because \"ping\" is the prevalent area unit in the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conversion Factor\n",
    "First, we set the conversion factor `sqm_to_ping` with a value of 3.305785. This value is used to convert square meters into ping.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Area Columns to Convert\n",
    "Next, we define a series of columns that need conversion. These columns include the total transaction area, parking area, main building area, auxiliary building area, and balcony area. These columns are identified with the codes `rps15`, `rps24`, `rps28`, `rps29`, and `rps30`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conversion Process\n",
    "- We use the `area_conversion` dictionary to map column names from the original dataset to the new naming convention.\n",
    "- By iterating through the dictionary using a loop, we convert the values of each specified column from square meters to ping.\n",
    "- Additionally, we convert the price per square meter (`rps22`) into the price per ping.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation of Public Facility Proportion\n",
    "- To analyze the structure of buildings in more depth, we calculate the proportion of public facilities. This is achieved by subtracting the area of all other components from the total area.\n",
    "- Ensuring that the resulting proportion falls within a reasonable range, typically between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this code segment is to transform key data in the dataset into a format more suitable for analysis in the Taiwanese market, making the analysis results more closely aligned with the actual conditions of the local real estate market."

    "- **Parking Ratio**: This represents the parking space area in relation to the total area of the property.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Average Area Ratios Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we calculate and visualize the average ratios of different areas related to real estate transactions. This analysis is crucial to understand how the space in properties is typically distributed among various components.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation of Average Ratios\n",
    "We calculate the average ratios for each type of area in the real estate transactions, which includes:\n",
    "- Main Building\n",
    "- Auxiliary Building\n",
    "- Balcony\n",
    "- Parking\n",
    "- Public Facility\n",
    "\n",
    "These ratios are calculated as the mean of their respective values in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bar Chart Visualization\n",
    "- A bar chart is used to visualize these average ratios.\n",
    "- The chart clearly represents each area type along the x-axis and their average ratios on the y-axis.\n",
    "- This visualization helps in comparing the relative sizes of different areas in the properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boxplot Visualization of Area Ratios\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the analysis involves creating boxplots for the same area ratios to understand their distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boxplot Features\n",
    "- Boxplots are drawn for Main Building, Auxiliary Building, Balcony,\n",
    "\n",
    " Parking, and Public Facility ratios.\n",
    "- Each boxplot provides a statistical summary of the distributions, including the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.\n",
    "- This visualization is particularly useful for identifying the range and variance of each ratio, offering insights into how uniformly or diversely each area type is represented across the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Visualizations: Stacked Bar Chart, Boxplot, and Violin Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stacked Bar Chart of Area Ratios\n",
    "- A stacked bar chart is created using a sample of the data.\n",
    "- This chart displays the composition of each transaction in terms of the different area ratios, offering a detailed view of each property's space allocation.\n",
    "- The visualization is useful for analyzing multiple components within individual transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boxplot and Violin Plot of Area Ratios\n",
    "- Additional boxplots and violin plots are generated for the main building, auxiliary building, balcony, and parking ratios.\n",
    "- While the boxplot provides a statistical summary, the violin plot combines the boxplot with a kernel density estimation, showing the distribution's density at different values.\n",
    "- These plots are instrumental in understanding the distribution of area ratios, highlighting areas with greater variance or skewness in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "These visualizations collectively offer a comprehensive view of how different areas within real estate properties are proportioned. The variety of charts - bar, boxplot, and violin plot - each contribute unique perspectives, aiding in a thorough understanding of the dataset's characteristics. The stacked bar chart, in particular, allows for an individualized transaction analysis, while the boxplot and violin plot offer more generalized, statistical insights into the overall data distribution."

    "### Analyzing the Impact of Property Layout on Price per Ping\n",
    "\n",
    "In this segment of our analysis, we delve into the influence of property layout on the pricing per Ping. The term \"layout\" refers to the configuration of rooms within a property, which is a significant factor in real estate valuation. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Layout Configuration\n",
    "The `layout_description` field provides a detailed composition of each property, signifying the number of rooms, halls (living/dining areas), and bathrooms. These are denoted by the following abbreviations in the dataset:\n",
    "- '房' (room)\n",
    "- '廳' (hall)\n",
    "- '衛' (bathroom)\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a \"3房2廳2衛\" layout describes a property with 3 rooms, 2 halls, and 2 bathrooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation of Area in Ping\n",
    "We convert the total area from square meters to Ping, a traditional Taiwanese unit of area, where 1 Ping is equal to 3.3058 square meters. This standard measurement allows for a consistent comparison across various properties and layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Price Analysis by Layout\n",
    "We compute the average price per Ping for each unique layout configuration, which provides insight into the market value attributed to different types of property layouts. This measure is crucial for understanding how the spatial arrangement within a property affects its price, reflecting buyer preferences and market trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results Presentation\n",
    "The average price per Ping is then sorted and displayed for each layout configuration. This sorted list offers a clear view of which property layouts command higher prices in the real estate market and will enable us to identify any patterns or preferences in property selection among buyers in the Tamsui District."

    "This section of the analysis targets a more statistical approach to examining the prices of selected property layouts within our dataset. We focus on a subset of property configurations to ascertain their market valuation and variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Selection of Property Layouts\n",
    "We have preselected a range of popular property layouts to include in our analysis, denoted by the number of rooms, halls, and bathrooms they contain. The layouts considered are:\n",
    "- '2房1廳1衛' (2 rooms, 1 hall, 1 bathroom)\n",

    "- '3房2廳1衛' (3 rooms, 2 halls, 1 bathroom)\n",
    "- '3房2廳2衛' (3 rooms, 2 halls, 2 bathrooms)\n",
    "\n",
    "These layouts represent a cross-section of the market that is diverse yet sufficiently common to provide a reliable insight into pricing trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation of Statistical Measures\n",
    "For each of the selected layouts, we compute several key statistical measures to understand their price distribution:\n",
    "- Count: The number of transactions for each layout, giving an indication of its popularity or availability in the market.\n",
    "- Mean: The average price per Ping, offering a baseline for comparison.\n",
    "- Quantile (20th percentile): This measure provides insight into the lower end of the price distribution, helping to identify what a buyer might expect to pay at a more accessible price point.\n",
    "- Median: The middle value of the price range, which can be more robust to outliers than the mean.\n",
    "- Standard Deviation: A measure of price variability, indicating the spread or dispersion of prices around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualization and Interpretation\n",
    "The calculated statistics are then presented, revealing the pricing dynamics and variability for each layout. This information is crucial for buyers, sellers, and analysts as it not only reflects the current market conditions but also helps in predicting future trends and in making informed decisions. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover patterns that can guide potential investment strategies and property development."

This visual representation allows us to observe not just the central tendencies like the median and mean, but also the variability and presence of outliers in the pricing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### English Translation of Layout Descriptions\n",

    "- '廳' (hall) to 'D'\n",
    "- '衛' (bathroom) to 'B'\n",
    "\n",
    "This translation facilitates a clearer interpretation of the plots for an international audience and makes the data more accessible.\n",

    "A pastel color palette is chosen to create the boxplots, offering a visually soothing and aesthetically pleasing look. The pastel colors are soft enough to not overpower the visual senses but are distinct enough to differentiate between the layout categories clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boxplot Creation and Display\n",
    "Using seaborn's `boxplot` function, we plot the data for each layout type, allowing us to compare the price ranges and distributions across the different layouts. The use of the pastel palette ensures that each category is easily identifiable, with the boxplot providing insights into the spread and skewness of prices within each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting plot includes the following elements:\n",
    "- The central box represents the interquartile range (IQR) of the dataset.\n",
    "- The line within the box shows the median price.\n",
    "- The 'whiskers' extend to show the range of the data within 1.5 IQRs from the quartiles, excluding outliers.\n",
    "- Outliers are plotted as individual points beyond the whiskers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization aids in understanding how layout configurations impact property prices, highlighting the variability and potential factors influencing buyer decisions. It is a valuable tool for stakeholders in the real estate market, including buyers, sellers, developers, and investors, providing them with actionable insights into property value trends."

    "This section of the notebook illustrates how the floor level may influence the price per Ping for properties within selected layouts. We use boxplots to compare the price distributions between properties on high floors versus low floors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Selection of Layouts and Floor Categories\n",
    "For a focused analysis, we've narrowed down our examination to two specific layouts:\n",
    "- '3R2D2B': 3 Rooms, 2 Halls, 2 Bathrooms\n",
    "- '2R2D1B': 2 Rooms, 2 Halls, 1 Bathroom\n",
    "\n",
    "These layouts are further categorized by their floor levels, allowing us to distinguish between 'High Floor' and 'Low Floor' properties, providing insights into the vertical dimension's impact on pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Custom Color Palette\n",
    "To visually represent the two categories of floor levels, we define a custom color palette:\n",
    "- Grass Green (`#229176`): Representing the 'High Floor' category, this color symbolizes an elevated position and possibly a premium in price or desirability.\n",
    "- Deep Green (`#005711`): Used for the 'Low Floor' category, suggesting a more grounded or traditional value perception.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boxplot Visualization\n",
    "The seaborn boxplot function is employed to create a comparison between the selected layouts. Each boxplot is color-coded to reflect its floor category, enabling an immediate visual interpretation of how floor levels might correlate with the property prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boxplot diagram includes:\n",
    "- Central boxes indicating the interquartile range of prices for each category.\n",
    "- Median prices represented by a line within the box.\n",
    "- Whiskers extending to show the full range of the data, giving a sense of price volatility.\n",
    "- Outliers indicated as individual points, which could represent unique value propositions or market anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation\n",
    "By plotting the boxplots for these categories side by side, we can discern any noticeable differences in the price ranges and distributions between different floors. Such insights can be instrumental for stakeholders, including developers who design floor plans, realtors who market these properties, and buyers who might prioritize certain floor levels based on price and personal preference. This analysis thus contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the Tamsui District's real estate market."
